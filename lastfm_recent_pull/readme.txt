This is a pair of scripts to handle pulling recently played tracks for a
Last.fm user into a MySQL database, where the data can be used for nefarious
purposes such as displaying recently played tracks on your website about your
cat.

The script pulls the following data on a song-per-song basis:

        - Song Title
        - Artist Name
        - Album Title
        - Time Played
        - Last.fm URL

It does NOT import things such as album covers, et cetera.
